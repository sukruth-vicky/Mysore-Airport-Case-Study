✈️ Mysore Airport Case Study

Level of Difficulty: Easy  
Inspired by: Parthenon-EY style cases (Wharton Casebook)  
Topics: Brainstorming, Market Sizing, Stakeholder Analysis, Profitability, Strategic Recommendation

Our company is pitching to the Director of Mysore Airport (MYQ), aiming to assist in the airport’s development and expansion plans.

Mysore Airport is a small domestic airport serving the Mysuru region of Karnataka, India, with a population of over 2.5 million. It is operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), and the Airport Director oversees operations and strategic growth.

🧠 Initial Brainstorming: Key Priorities for the Airport Director

- Passengers: Ensuring a positive travel experience to maintain and increase airport usage.
- Airlines: Maintaining profitability and attracting carriers to serve Mysore.
- Vendors: Supporting airport vendors to enhance passenger satisfaction and generate revenue.

🔢 Market Sizing: Estimating Annual Passenger Traffic

Flight-Based Estimation
- 10 flights per day  
- 72 seats per flight (ATR-72 aircraft)  
- 75% average occupancy  
- 365 days per year  

Calculation:  
10 × 72 × 0.75 × 365 ≈ 197,100 passengers annually

Population-Based Estimation
- Frequent Business Travelers (5%): 2.5M × 5% × 12 trips/year = 1.5M  
- Casual Travelers (15%): 2.5M × 15% × 2 trips/year = 0.75M  
- Occasional Travelers (20%): 2.5M × 20% × 1 trip/year = 0.5M  
- Incoming Tourists: ~500,000 annually  

Total estimate: ~3.25 million passengers annually

🏗️ Decision Scenario: Lounge vs Restaurant

| Feature          | Restaurant       | Lounge          |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Average Bill/Entry | ₹600             | ₹1500           |
| Cost              | ₹240             | ₹600            |
| Profit per user   | ₹360             | ₹900            |

Analysis:  
- Both are profitable, lounge more so per user.  
- Restaurant caters to broader passengers, families, and leisure travelers.  
- Lounge preferred by premium business travelers.  
- Vendor ecosystem impact considered.

✅ Recommendation

- Start with a sit-down restaurant to boost overall passenger satisfaction and vendor ecosystem.  
- Phase in a premium lounge once passenger traffic grows beyond 500,000 annually.  

📚 Key Learnings

- Structured problem-solving and stakeholder analysis are crucial.  
- Market sizing can be approached from both supply (flights) and demand (population) sides.  
- Financial and strategic considerations help prioritize airport development projects.
